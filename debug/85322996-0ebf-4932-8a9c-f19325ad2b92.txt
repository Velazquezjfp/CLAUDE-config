  What Was Changed

  File Modified: frontend/src/components/ResourceForm.jsx:5-14

  Change: Updated the QUALIFICATIONS constant from incorrect values to match the canonical database schema:

  // BEFORE (incorrect):
  const QUALIFICATIONS = [
    'electrical', 'mechanical', 'hydraulic', 'electronic',
    'signaling', 'track_work', 'overhead_lines', 'safety_systems'
  ];

  // AFTER (correct):
  const QUALIFICATIONS = [
    'catenary_work', 'electrical_systems', 'heavy_equipment',
    'safety_officer', 'signaling', 'team_leader',
    'track_maintenance', 'welding'
  ];

  Verification Results

  âœ… UI Rendering: Confirmed that the existing UI logic (line 296) correctly handles the new values:
  - Underscores are converted to spaces for display
  - CSS capitalize class formats the text properly
  - All 8 qualifications will render correctly

  âœ… Form Logic: No changes needed to form submission or validation logic

  âœ… Scope Compliance: Strictly adhered to frontend-only scope (no backend, database, or solver changes)

  Impact

  This change immediately fixes the qualification mismatch between:
  - âœ… Resources module (now uses correct values)
  - âœ… Requests module (already used correct values)
  - âœ… Database schema (already stores correct values)
  - âœ… Solver validation (already validates correct values)")
