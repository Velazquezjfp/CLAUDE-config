  What Was Accomplished

  1. Documentation

  - Created: docs/NFR-001/reference-data.md
  - Comprehensive documentation of domain value hierarchy
  - Maintenance procedures for adding/removing qualifications and locations
  - Testing guidelines and troubleshooting section

  2. Backend API

  - Created: api/routes/reference.py
    - New GET /api/reference endpoint
    - Returns qualifications (8 values from schema CHECK constraints)
    - Returns locations (11 values queried from database)
    - Returns contract_types, resource_types, objective_types
  - Modified: api/app.py
    - Registered new reference blueprint

  3. Frontend API Service

  - Modified: frontend/src/services/api.js
    - Added getReferenceData() function

  4. Frontend Forms

  - Modified: frontend/src/components/ResourceForm.jsx
    - Removed hardcoded QUALIFICATIONS constant
    - Now fetches qualifications from /api/reference on mount
    - Added loading states and error handling
  - Modified: frontend/src/components/RequestForm.jsx
    - Same changes as ResourceForm
    - Both forms now use centralized API endpoint The app is running in http://localhost:5173/, backend in loclahost:5000 and frontend in localhost:3000, use playwright mcp for frontend testing.")
