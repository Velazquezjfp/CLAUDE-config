  ---
  ✅ F-001 Implementation Complete!

  What Was Changed

  File Modified: frontend/src/components/ResourceForm.jsx:5-14

  Change: Updated the QUALIFICATIONS constant from incorrect values to match the canonical database schema:

  // BEFORE (incorrect):
  const QUALIFICATIONS = [
    'electrical', 'mechanical', 'hydraulic', 'electronic',
    'signaling', 'track_work', 'overhead_lines', 'safety_systems'
  ];

  // AFTER (correct):
  const QUALIFICATIONS = [
    'catenary_work', 'electrical_systems', 'heavy_equipment',
    'safety_officer', 'signaling', 'team_leader',
    'track_maintenance', 'welding'
  ];

  Verification Results

  ✅ UI Rendering: Confirmed that the existing UI logic (line 296) correctly handles the new values:
  - Underscores are converted to spaces for display
  - CSS capitalize class formats the text properly
  - All 8 qualifications will render correctly

  ✅ Form Logic: No changes needed to form submission or validation logic

  ✅ Scope Compliance: Strictly adhered to frontend-only scope (no backend, database, or solver changes)

  Impact

  This change immediately fixes the qualification mismatch between:
  - ✅ Resources module (now uses correct values)
  - ✅ Requests module (already used correct values)
  - ✅ Database schema (already stores correct values)
  - ✅ Solver validation (already validates correct values)

  Next Steps

  Recommended:
  1. Test the changes: Run the test cases TC-F-001-01 through TC-F-001-06 to verify functionality
  2. Parallel implementation: You can now proceed with F-002 (location standardization) in parallel
  3. Start frontend server: Test the UI manually to see the 8 qualifications display correctly

  Would you like me to:
  - Help run the test cases for F-001?
  - Proceed with implementing F-002 (location fix)?
  - Start the frontend server to manually verify the changes?")

[ERROR] OpenTelemetry telemetry flush timed out after 1000ms

To resolve this issue, you can:
1. Increase the timeout by setting CLAUDE_CODE_OTEL_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT_MS env var (e.g., 5000 for 5 seconds)
2. Check if your OpenTelemetry backend is experiencing scalability issues
3. Disable OpenTelemetry by unsetting CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_TELEMETRY env var

Current timeout: 1000ms
