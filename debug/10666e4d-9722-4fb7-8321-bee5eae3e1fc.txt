[DEBUG] UserCommandMessage rendering: "start-test-requirement is running…" (args: "D-001  I've successfully implemented all validation and debugging enhancements for qualification constraint alignment. Here's what was done:

  1. Debug Logging Added to Solver (solver.py:64-76)

  - Added logging import to the solver module
  - Enhanced add_qualification_constraints() method with debug logging
  - When a resource lacks required qualifications, the solver now logs:
    - Resource ID
    - Request ID
    - Specific missing qualifications
  - Log format: "Resource {id} lacks qualifications for {request}: missing {quals}"

  2. Validation Added to Data Models (data_models.py)

  Both Resource and Request dataclasses now include:
  - Class constant: VALID_QUALIFICATIONS defining the canonical 8 qualifications
  - __post_init__ validation that:
    - Ensures qualifications/required_qualifications is a set
    - Validates non-empty qualification set
    - Validates all qualifications are in the canonical list
    - Raises ValueError with clear error messages if validation fails

  3. CHECK Constraints Added to Database (schema.sql)

  Both qualification tables now enforce valid values at the database level:
  - resource_qualifications.qualification: CHECK constraint added
  - request_qualifications.qualification: CHECK constraint added
  - Constraint validates against: 'catenary_work', 'electrical_systems', 'heavy_equipment', 'safety_officer', 'signaling', 'team_leader', 'track_maintenance',
  'welding'

  Validation Pipeline

  Database (CHECK constraints)
    ↓
  DatabaseManager (loads data)
    ↓
  Data Models (__post_init__ validation)
    ↓
  Solver (constraint generation + debug logging)")
