  - Before: <option key={loc.id} value={loc.id}>{loc.name}</option>
  - After: <option key={loc.id} value={loc.name}>{loc.name}</option>

  What This Fixes

  The ResourceForm location dropdown now uses location names (e.g., "Lausanne", "Zurich") as the value attribute instead of location IDs. This ensures:

  1. Database consistency: The resources.home_location column stores location names (TEXT) that match the foreign key constraint to locations.name
  2. Backend compatibility: The API validation already expects location names, not IDs
  3. Pattern consistency: ResourceForm now matches RequestForm.jsx (line 167), which was already using the correct pattern

  Scope Adherence

  ✅ Only modified ResourceForm.jsx (as specified in implementation plan)✅ No backend changes (already correct)✅ No database changes (schema already correct)✅ No
   RequestForm changes (already using correct pattern)")
