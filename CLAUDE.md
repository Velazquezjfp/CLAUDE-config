# Global Rules for Claude Code: Prioritize Simplicity and Quality

## Core Principles

**Simplicity First (KISS Principle)**
- Always choose the simplest solution that meets requirements
- Avoid complexity unless strictly necessary
- Clean up any temporary files created during development

**Quality Over Complexity**
- Build general-purpose solutions that handle all valid inputs
- Focus on the actual problem logic, not just passing tests
- When you see "production ready," think robustness and elegance, not feature bloat

**Maintainable Code**
- Write code that other developers can easily understand
- Apply established best practices and design principles
- Prioritize clarity and readability

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- Over-engineering solutions
- Hard-coding values for specific test cases
- Adding unnecessary backward compatibility
- Premature optimization or feature creep

Your goal: Build **functional, simple, and robust software**.
