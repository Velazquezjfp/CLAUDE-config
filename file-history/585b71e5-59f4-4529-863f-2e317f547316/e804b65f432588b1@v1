Test Case: TC-F-003-05
Requirement: F-003 - Implement batch processing with internal summaries for AI insights
Description: Verify batch summaries are cached properly to avoid redundant processing

    # TODO: Test caching behavior of batch summaries
    # Expected behavior:
    # 1. Process 1000 records in 2 batches
    # 2. Call generate_pattern_analysis() again immediately
    # 3. Verify batch summaries are cached (no new API calls for batch processing)
    # 4. Only final verdict generation should trigger new API call if data unchanged
    #
    # Implementation notes:
    # - AIInsightsGenerator should cache batch summaries based on data hash or timestamp
    # - Cache key could be: last_modified_timestamp of inference_results table
    # - If no new records added, batch summaries should be reused
    #

    # api_calls_second = 0

    # with patch('google.generativeai.GenerativeModel.generate_content') as mock_api:
    #     # First generation
    #     mock_api.return_value.text = "Summary"
    #     generator.generate_pattern_analysis()
    #     api_calls_first = mock_api.call_count

    #     # Second generation (should use cache)
    #     generator.generate_pattern_analysis()
    #     api_calls_second = mock_api.call_count
    #
    #     # Second call should make fewer API requests (cached batches)
