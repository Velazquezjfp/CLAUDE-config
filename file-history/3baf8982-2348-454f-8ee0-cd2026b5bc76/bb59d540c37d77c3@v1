    # TODO: Implement Playwright test using MCP Playwright
    # Based on requirement Changes Required:
    # - Frontend: RequestForm.jsx should fetch from /api/reference (not hardcoded QUALIFICATIONS)
    # - API: GET /api/reference returns qualifications array
    # - Expected: Dropdown displays all qualifications from /api/reference

    # Steps:
    # 1. Navigate to Requests module
    # 2. Monitor network requests (if possible with Playwright)
    # 3. Verify RequestForm makes GET request to /api/reference on load
    # 4. Locate QUALIFICATIONS dropdown
    # 5. Open dropdown to view options
    # 6. Verify dropdown contains exactly 8 options
    # 7. Verify each option matches response from /api/reference endpoint
    # 8. Verify dropdown options match ResourceForm (consistency check)
