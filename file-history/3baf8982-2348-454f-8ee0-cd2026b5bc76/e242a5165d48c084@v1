def test_TC_NFR_001_06():
    """Verify frontend qualification values exactly match backend validation rules"""
    # TODO: Implement integration test
    # Based on requirement Changes Required:
    # - Frontend: ResourceForm.jsx and RequestForm.jsx QUALIFICATIONS constants
    # - Backend: Database CHECK constraints or validation rules
    # - Expected: Exact match between all layers

    # Test checks alignment across:
    # 1. Frontend ResourceForm.jsx QUALIFICATIONS constant
    # 2. Frontend RequestForm.jsx QUALIFICATIONS constant
    # 3. Backend /api/reference endpoint response
    # 4. Database schema CHECK constraints or reference data

    # Steps:
    # 1. Read ResourceForm.jsx, extract QUALIFICATIONS constant (or /api/reference call)
    # 2. Read RequestForm.jsx, extract QUALIFICATIONS constant (or /api/reference call)
    # 3. Call GET /api/reference, extract qualifications array
    # 4. Query database for qualification validation rules/constraints
    # 5. Verify all four sources contain identical qualification sets
    # 6. Verify count: exactly 8 qualifications
    # 7. Verify names: exact string match (case-sensitive, no transformations)
    # 8. Report any mismatches with source location and value difference
