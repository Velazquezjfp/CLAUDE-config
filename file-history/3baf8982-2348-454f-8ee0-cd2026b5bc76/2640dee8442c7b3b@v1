Test Case: TC-NFR-001-03
Requirement: NFR-001 - Establish single source of truth for domain value validation
Description: Add new qualification 'crane_operation' to database, call GET /api/reference, verify it appears in qualifications array

    # TODO: Implement database + API integration test
    # Based on requirement Changes Required:
    # - Database: Source of truth for domain values
    # - Endpoint: GET /api/reference should dynamically query database
    # - Expected: New qualifications added to database appear in API response

    # Test qualification: 'crane_operation' (not in canonical list)

    # Steps:
    # 1. Setup: Query /api/reference to get baseline qualifications (should be 8)
    # 2. Setup: Add new qualification 'crane_operation' to database
    #    - Method depends on schema: May need to add to CHECK constraint or reference table
    # 3. Execute: Call GET /api/reference again
    # 4. Verify: Response now contains 9 qualifications
    # 5. Verify: 'crane_operation' appears in qualifications array
    # 6. Verify: All original 8 qualifications still present
    # 7. Cleanup: Remove 'crane_operation' from database
    # 8. Verify: GET /api/reference returns to 8 qualifications
