  "recommendations": [
    "Install Java 11+ JDK to enable emulator functionality (sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk or equivalent)",
    "Run 'firebase login' to authenticate Firebase CLI for full feature access",
    "After Java installation, re-run TC-F-001-02 and TC-F-001-03 to verify emulator startup",

  "conclusion": "Configuration is complete and correct (4/6 tests passed). Implementation of F-001 requirement is successful, but runtime environment lacks Java 11+ prerequisite for actual emulator execution. All configuration files (package.json, firebase.json, .gitignore) are properly set up."
