Test Case: TC-F-002-02
Requirement: F-002 - Standardize location values across frontend, backend, and database
Description: Create resource with home_location='Location 2', verify API returns 400 error with message "Location 'Location 2' not found"

def test_TC_F_002_02():
    """Verify API rejects invalid location with clear error message"""
    # TODO: Implement API test
    # Based on requirement Changes Required:
    # - Backend: api/routes/resources.py should validate location against locations table
    # - Database: resources.home_location foreign key references locations.name
    # - Expected: API returns 400 error with message "Location 'Location 2' not found"

    # Invalid location: 'Location 2' (not in locations table)

    # Steps:
    # 1. Prepare POST request to /api/resources with JSON payload
    # 2. Set home_location='Location 2' (invalid location)
    # 3. Include valid values for other required fields
    # 4. Send request to API
    # 5. Verify response status code = 400 (Bad Request)
    # 6. Verify response body contains error message: "Location 'Location 2' not found"
    # 7. Verify no resource was created in database
