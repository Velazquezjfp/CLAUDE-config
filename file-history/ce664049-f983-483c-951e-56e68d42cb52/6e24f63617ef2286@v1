Test Case: TC-F-002-07
Requirement: F-002 - Standardize location values across frontend, backend, and database
Description: Create resource at 'Bern', create request at 'Zurich', run solver, verify travel distance calculation uses distance matrix correctly (Bern to Zurich = 120 km)

def test_TC_F_002_07():
    """Verify solver correctly calculates travel distance using standardized location names"""
    # TODO: Implement solver integration test
    # Based on requirement Changes Required:
    # - Solver: Should use location names to look up distances in distance matrix
    # - Database: Distance matrix stores distances between canonical location names
    # - Expected: Distance calculation for Bernâ†’Zurich returns 120 km

    # Canonical locations:
    # - Resource location: 'Bern'
    # - Request location: 'Zurich'
    # - Expected distance: 120 km (from distance matrix)

    # Steps:
    # 1. Setup: Create resource R_BERN with home_location='Bern' in database
    # 2. Setup: Create request REQ_ZURICH with location='Zurich' in database
    # 3. Execute: Run solver with travel distance constraints enabled
    # 4. Verify: Check solver log/debug output for distance calculation
    # 5. Verify: Distance from Bern to Zurich = 120 km (exact match from distance matrix)
    # 6. Verify: Solver successfully processes assignment (no location name mismatch errors)
    # 7. Cleanup: Remove test resource R_BERN and request REQ_ZURICH
