# Analysis System Tests

This folder contains unit tests for individual constraint and objective analyzers.

## Purpose

These tests verify that each analyzer correctly:
- Analyzes violations from solver metadata
- Classifies severity (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH)
- Generates fix suggestions
- Provides weight adjustment recommendations
- Checks if simulated assignments would violate constraints

## Test Files

- `test_lc02_analyzer.py` - Tests LC_02 (14-hour span) analyzer
- `test_lc03_analyzer.py` - Tests LC_03 (absolute daily hours) analyzer
- `test_cp02_analyzer.py` - Tests CP_02 (qualification matching) analyzer

## Running Tests

```bash
# From solver_v2/ directory
python analysis/tests/test_lc02_analyzer.py
python analysis/tests/test_lc03_analyzer.py
python analysis/tests/test_cp02_analyzer.py
```

## When to Use

These tests are useful when:
1. **Creating a new analyzer** - Use as templates to verify basic functionality
2. **Debugging analyzer behavior** - Test in isolation without running full solver
3. **Verifying changes** - Ensure updates don't break existing analyzers

## Note

These are **development tests**, not production unit tests. The full analysis system is tested through `main.py` integration testing.
