Test Case: TC-F-001-04
Requirement: F-001 - Standardize qualification values across frontend, backend, and solver
Description: Create resource R002 with qualifications ['track_maintenance'], create request REQ002 requiring ['electrical_systems'], run solver, verify R002 is NOT assigned to REQ002 (qualification mismatch)

def test_TC_F_001_04():
    """Verify solver correctly excludes resources lacking required qualifications"""
    # TODO: Implement solver constraint validation test
    # Based on requirement Changes Required:
    # - Solver: solver.py:64-76 should add constraint x[r,req]=0 when qualifications don't match
    # - Data model: data_models.py:40-42 has_qualifications() returns False when subset check fails
    # - Expected: Resource R002 should be excluded from assignment to REQ002

    # Steps:
    # 1. Setup: Create resource R002 with qualifications=['track_maintenance'] in database
    # 2. Setup: Create request REQ002 with required_qualifications=['electrical_systems'] in database
    # 3. Execute: Run solver with debug logging enabled
    # 4. Verify: Check solver constraints - must have x[R002,REQ002]=0 constraint added
    # 5. Verify: Check solver solution - R002 must NOT be assigned to REQ002
    # 6. Verify: Check debug log contains message about R002 lacking qualifications for REQ002
    # 7. Cleanup: Remove test resource R002 and request REQ002 from database
