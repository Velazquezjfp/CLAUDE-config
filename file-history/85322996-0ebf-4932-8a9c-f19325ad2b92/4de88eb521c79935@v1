Test Case: TC-F-001-03
Requirement: F-001 - Standardize qualification values across frontend, backend, and solver
Description: Create resource R001 with qualifications ['electrical_systems', 'catenary_work'], create request REQ001 requiring ['electrical_systems'], run solver, verify R001 is eligible for assignment to REQ001

def test_TC_F_001_03():
    """Verify solver recognizes resource qualifications matching request requirements"""
    # TODO: Implement solver integration test
    # Based on requirement Changes Required:
    # - Solver: solver.py:64-76 uses Resource.has_qualifications() method
    # - Data model: data_models.py:40-42 validates required_qualifications.issubset(resource.qualifications)
    # - Expected: Resource R001 should be eligible for assignment to REQ001

    # Steps:
    # 1. Setup: Create resource R001 with qualifications=['electrical_systems', 'catenary_work'] in database
    # 2. Setup: Create request REQ001 with required_qualifications=['electrical_systems'] in database
    # 3. Execute: Run solver (solver.py) with objective and constraints
    # 4. Verify: Check solver output - R001 should NOT have constraint x[R001,REQ001]=0 (meaning R001 is eligible)
    # 5. Verify: Check solver solution - R001 may be assigned to REQ001 (depending on optimization)
    # 6. Cleanup: Remove test resource R001 and request REQ001 from database
