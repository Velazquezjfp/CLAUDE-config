The current data shows more than 250 inferences from BERT and more than 182 inferences from the LLM, how can the total inferences be 100?

I like how it looks, but I´m worried about how the database records are retrieved for Gemini API to actually process this?, I´m worried because I know there is a token limit, so I would like to process on batches. Implement a mechanism to retrieve 500 records at a time. Make a summary internally and when no more records are available then create the last veredict based on the summaries from batches. I need help with this requirement to make it follow a good strategy for this kind of assessments. \n\nCheck the screenshot for reference: '//wsl.localhost/Ubuntu/home/javiervel/clients/projects_screenshots/ai-timesheet/ai-insights.jpg'\n\n4.- I need a command to be able to erase all records from the database, there is endpoints to the dashboard app, there should be APIs in the sqlite database, I need an endpoint that allows me to send a remove all records action, for safety in the request this code should be added: 270195, I need this because I want to be able to start the database from scratch. \n\n5.- I need to modify the main inference app to pass a value called \"test\" this should be true or false, if it is true then the inference shouldn´t be saved in the sqlite table, that process should be skipped. if its false then everything should work as normal. \n\n  ","pastedContents":{},"timestamp":1759323001362,"project":"/home/javiervel/clients/bosenet/ai-timesheet/inference/docker_files_api_copy2"}

Please carefully check the backend scripts,\nspecially under the API folder. This will give you a clue of how the restrictions are being applied when solving requests.\n\nYou will notice that plans run one time and it solves the resources allocation. I need you to evaluate this 2 types of follow ups with an agent, an exactly which inputs the agent would need to be able to accurately help the user on planning: \n\nCase scenario 1:  questions about the high level performance.  \nWhich certifications/ qualifications are most needed to solve this plan? \nWould it be possible to keep all teams together?\nWhat would be needed if I want to maximize savings?\n\nCase scenario 2:  questions about grannular information and specific solutions.\nHow many shifts is Jhon Doe covering?\nIf Martina takes holidays on the 12th, how would that impact the planning? \nhow may angineers are working over hours?

{"display":"I dont need to build anything, I just want an analysis of what would be possible. In order to answer high level questions and specific ones, what is needed? What would an agent need as an input? what would be the mechanism. Do not modify anything in the code base, just answer my questions. \n\nDont modify tehcodebase\nDont add or create files\nDo - output plans as text response in this conversation. \n\nWhat you mentioned about high and low (granular level) makes a lot of sense and is really useful. I have the next follow-up questions: \nIf the resources are allocated, then all the info is there for an agent to look up a name right? The plan output should have row by row all the allocations bu person, so filtering a person name, even by simmilarity, or filtering qualifications should be possible. \n\nThe reason why I'm asking this, is related to the granular follow ups and questions. \n\nAdditionally how hard would it be to calculate cascade events as a forecast? for example once the planner is calculated, is it feasible to do follow ups like: what if this resource is not available in november? than a cascade analysis needs to be implemente, would this require a lot of effort? or the path to calculate this can be done with the planner itself? using the clauclations and all the methods that are already there for gaps analyser and so on?\n\nThe ultimate question to answer: isn't more feasible and easy to focus on high level questions? like \"how many extra resources would I need to be able to reduce travel distance and therfore over hours?\" \n\nWhat I mean with this is that the engine recalculates everytime. If there is modifications, it needs to re-run the planner, it never attempts to do specific modifications, does that make sense? \n\nIn the same way, the scope is not on the granular level, like managing specific cases for specific people, but more on the high level about team continuity, efficiency, travel time. \n\nQuestions then would be related to: \n- Resources: \nHow many employees are working over hours?\nIs there modifications that we can do to increase the rest day rate?  \n\n- Optimization:\nWho are the most expensive resources? \n\n- Constrains: \nWho is not with their team in more than 50% of their shifts?\nWould it be feasible to cover everything with internal resources? \n\nLast question: is it a good idea to create another module that allows creation of constrains? in that way the agent could add contrains that are not in the original planner, for example add the contrain to fully cover a specific site. Now here is a follow up question: if we go into specifics, like blocking a person on a range of dates, isnt that introducing highly complex restrictions? as every single employee/resource would be identifieble? I think constrains should focus in objetcs with less quantities, like sites (the physical places for mantainance). \n\nplease do not give me the reason, be honest and assess what is more feasible.
