The current data shows more than 250 inferences from BERT and more than 182 inferences from the LLM, how can the total inferences be 100?

I like how it looks, but I´m worried about how the database records are retrieved for Gemini API to actually process this?, I´m worried because I know there is a token limit, so I would like to process on batches. Implement a mechanism to retrieve 500 records at a time. Make a summary internally and when no more records are available then create the last veredict based on the summaries from batches. I need help with this requirement to make it follow a good strategy for this kind of assessments. \n\nCheck the screenshot for reference: '//wsl.localhost/Ubuntu/home/javiervel/clients/projects_screenshots/ai-timesheet/ai-insights.jpg'\n\n4.- I need a command to be able to erase all records from the database, there is endpoints to the dashboard app, there should be APIs in the sqlite database, I need an endpoint that allows me to send a remove all records action, for safety in the request this code should be added: 270195, I need this because I want to be able to start the database from scratch. \n\n5.- I need to modify the main inference app to pass a value called \"test\" this should be true or false, if it is true then the inference shouldn´t be saved in the sqlite table, that process should be skipped. if its false then everything should work as normal. \n\n  ","pastedContents":{},"timestamp":1759323001362,"project":"/home/javiervel/clients/bosenet/ai-timesheet/inference/docker_files_api_copy2"}
